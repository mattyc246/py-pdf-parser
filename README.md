# Python Hello World

A minimal Python script in the current directory.

## Run

```
python3 main.py
```

## Notes

- Prefer pyenv (installed on this machine) instead of venv. Example setup:
  - `pyenv install 3.11.7` (if not already installed)
  - `pyenv local 3.11.7` (sets version for this folder)
  - `python -m pip install --upgrade pip` (optional)
- No additional dependencies needed yet. Add tools later as desired (e.g., pytest, ruff, mypy).
